# Simple Discord Bot

Hi guys, this is my first GitHub repository and, as you can read from the title, itâ€™s a simple Discord bot. The main purpose of the bot is to play music from YouTube and audio files.

### Installation
After cloning the repository, create a "config.json" with the following structure:

    "token": "XXXXXXX",
    "GuildID": "XXXXXXX"

and replace "XXXXXXX" with the token of your bot and the Guild id where you want to set up the bot.


## Technologies Used
1. Node.js
2. Discord.js
3. ytdl-core (for playing audio from YouTube)
4. play-dl (light-weight youtube searcher)
